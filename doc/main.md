# AlmaBTE

The goal of project ALMA is to enable the predictive design of heat management materials and structures. Heat management constitutes a grand challenge that blocks further development in disciplines as varied as nanoelectronics, power devices, phase change memories, high temperature turbines, or thermoelectric energy conversion, to cite a few [1]. Further progress requires the help of accurate modeling tools that can predict the performance of new complex materials integrated in these increasingly demanding novel devices.

The AlmaBTE software package developed by this project will extend the “ShengBTE” approach currently employed for homogeneous bulk materials, into the mesoscale, to fully describe thermal transport from the electronic ab initio level, through the atomistic one, all the way into the mesoscopic structure level. AlmaBTE is oriented towards industrial applications, particularly in the rapidly evolving field of GaN based power electronics, and in all new technologies where thermal transport is a key issue.

ALMA was launched in June 2015, and is funded by the European Commission through the Horizon 2020 – Research and Innovation Framework Programme, for a three year duration.
